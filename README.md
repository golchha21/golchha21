Web platform owner focused on performance, UX, and long-term maintainability.

I build and evolve web platforms with an emphasis on clean UI, intuitive UX, technical SEO, accessibility, and systems that hold up over time. My work spans architecture, frontend development, optimization, and deployment, with a strong bias toward clarity, reliability, and sustainable improvement.

I care less about shipping fast and more about shipping things that don’t need to be rewritten later.

## How I think about work

- Ownership matters more than titles  
- Performance and clarity are features  
- Systems should get easier to maintain over time  
- Tooling should reduce cognitive load, not add to it
